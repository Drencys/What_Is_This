# "Disables" Defender by adding exclusions and turning off advanced bits. Run this under an elevated powershell prompt
# Defender will be essentially gutted/disabled without messing with any files/underlying services. Windows Security center will still display that AV is working etc.

# WARNING: This is intended to be run on fully patched machines. It will fail if run on older versions of Windows 10/11.
# WARNING: This is intended to work on RE/Malware research machines and it's ability to alter MDE configurations will depend on how MDE policy is configured. 
# WARNING: TL;DR This is not intended to be run on a managed device.
